There are three very terrible things about loneliness.

## It's Your Fault

A lot of lonely people look like they should not be lonely. For example, I come from a loving family, get good grades, go to MIT, and am surrounded by passionate, enthusiastic students every day. It looks like I have a great life. But I am lonely. I don't have any close friends. I don't get invited. 

It's very easy for me to blame myself. I should've talked more with my classmates. I should've attended more events. I should've had deeper conversations with the people I talk to. I should've cared more. I should be a more interesting person.

The truth is, it is probably my fault. But I don't blame myself because nothing good comes out of it. There is something that I am missing in my social interactions. Am I not proactive enough? Do I run out of things to talk about? Do I stay in unwelcoming social circles? Whatever it is, I just need to figure it out. 

Bocchi is scared to socialize, and I have no idea how to socialize. We're quite similar.

## You'll Be Like This Forever

There's one thought that constantly hangs over my head. "Will you be lonely for the rest of your life?"

It's there when I wake up. It's there after lecture ends. It's there during lunch and dinner. It's there late at night, when I think about the things I didn't do that day.

I hate it. I'd do anything to get rid of it. But until I figure something out, it's not going anywhere.

To make matters worse, this single thought makes life much more unenjoyable. Whenever something good happens, like finishing a TV show, cooking some good food, or getting a good grade on a test, you can't share the happiness with someone else. That reminds you of how lonely you are, making that happiness disappear. To stop thinking about your loneliness, you then seek out more sources of entertainment. Games, Youtube, social media, etc. Of course, these things only make you feel worse.

It's hard to hold your chin up when you're lonely.

## No One Will Save You

In lots of anime, there is the lonely MC that sits in the back left corner of the classroom. For some random reason, a beautiful, charismatic girl shows interest in them, and through a series of inprobable events, they get a friend group.

Real life doesn't work that way. Nobody cares that much about you. So if you're lonely, nobody will go out of their way to make you un-lonely. It is your responsibility to socialize and make friends.

This is especially bad for lazy people like me. Throughout middle and high school, I've told myself that I was perfectly fine staying at home, playing video games, and watching anime. I told myself I didn't need other people. Right now, I no longer think that way, but why go out of your way to socialize when you have the comforts of Discord, Youtube, and Gogoanime? 

## Was MIT the Right Choice?

A lot of MIT students said that when they were at MIT, they loved the community and the many friendships they made. It's expected, since MIT admits people who are creative, hard-working, and passionate. 

It doesn't feel that way to me right now.

Chris Peterson has said that MIT students are extremely intrinsically motivated. That they themselves have the desire and willpower to do great things. MIT is made extremely difficult to fit the needs of these intrinsically motivated students. The rigor is supposed to strengthen student relationships, since it forces them to work together. But for me, this has the opposite effect. When I am physically and mentally exhausted from my psets and exams, I don't have the energy to connect with others. Most of the time, I just lie face-down on my bed, like the lazy ass I am. 

This makes me question if MIT was the right choice. But I'm not sure. If I went to some other university, there is a chance that I would be as lonely, or even lonelier, than I am at MIT.

I see this in the anime club. Everyone at club showings looks dead inside. Maybe because anime caters to a specific kind of personality that I fit into. Although I do love anime, this kind of attitude makes me feel like I'm in the wrong group. Later, I might go to more clubs and see if others have a different culture. Even if I'm dead inside, if the people around me aren't, I might become less dead inside.

## Conclusion

I don't have an answer to loneliness yet. I've tried to socialize, but I just got more acquaintances, no better than my social situation in high school. There are so many things I am great at, but it turns out my hardest challenge is what's quite simple for many: making friends. I long for the day when I can share special moments with even one person.
